In highschool, my code writing took a journey from BASIC to Pascal to C and finally C++. While my college career was focused heavily on the Microsoft stack, I also learned how to program microcontrollers, Xbox games, and got my first introduction to the web of client-server with PHP. I chose a career in Software Engineering because I recognized that designing and writing applications was something I had enough passion in to carry forward into the later part of my life with infinite passion. I am a maker, a tinkerer, a person who likes to see how things are designed and marvel at just how much machines can accomplish with such elegant engineering. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    My first experience in the industry was with a web development agency in downtown Portland, Oregon. I was working on an ASP.NET CMS framework that was in use by several clients for their e-commerce websites. A year later the agency dissolved and I quickly formed my own LLC to be able to freelance my skills and talents. Determined to continue to be a part of a dev team I began working for a product company, also on the .NET stack, and was brought onto their systems team to focus on their web portal. Following my time with that company I decided to put my full time efforts into contracting and working remotely, so I started working with another agency on a couple of Wordpress/PHP projects and went traveling. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    When I returned to Portland I had learned enough to know that being on a team was important to me. I had been looking to open source my development projects and was keen on finding a team of others who also shared the open source mindset, thus I found myself at another web development agency in downtown working on projects using nodejs with javascript both on the server and client side. I have to say that I am in love with single language development stacks! Now, whenever I start a new project I advocate for it being open source and I dedicate my life to a balance between working in an office and working outside of an office. \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"footer\">\n            <p style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\n                I am available for hire on a contract or remote basis, please send me an email for more information:\n                <a style=\"text-decoration: none;color:white;\" href=\"mailto:hello@keneucker.com\">hello@keneucker.com</a>                \n            </p>\n        </section>\n        <section class=\"ig-view\">\n            <div class=\"ig-overlay\"><i class=\"fa fa-instagram\"></i></div>\n            <script src=\"//lightwidget.com/widgets/lightwidget.js\"></script>\n            <iframe src=\"//lightwidget.com/widgets/cbef6df707c6519e97927ad578e3b941.html\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"lightwidget-widget\" style=\"width: 100%; border: 0; overflow: hidden\"></iframe>\n        </section>\n        <!-- JS scripts -->   \n        <script src=\"./js/index.js\"></script>  \n\n    </body>\n</html>",
